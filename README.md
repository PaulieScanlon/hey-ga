Google Analytics Agent | A [Mastra Hackathon](https://mastra.ai/hackathon) project. Submit your Agent [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5_s9okeyicUJqQGmDofn_Mz6teAIDuyAz7o94gqAlYZCEeQ/viewform).

This Agent can be used to query Google Analytics data using natural language, for example:

> Show me the top page views by page title in the last 30 days
> <br/>
> Where in the world have my visitors come from in the last 30 days?
> <br />
> What referrers have driven traffic to my site in the last 30 days?

The agent will ask follow-up questions to better understand your request, then provide a helpful list of answers.

## Getting started

This project uses OpenAI [gpt-4o-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini) and the [Google Analytics Data: Node.js Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-analytics/data).

### Setup

You'll need x3 environment variables to use this Agent.

1. `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. `GA4_PROPERTY_ID`
3. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_BASE64`

Start by running the below, then add you API and property keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
```

## Google Credentials

Setting up and then using Google Credentials is, in my opinion, harder than it needs to be. To help you out, Iâ€™ve written two blog posts that should guide you through the process.

1. [Creating a Google Cloud Project | Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/09/how-create-weekly-google-analytics-report-posts-slack/#creating-a-google-cloud-project)
2. [How to Use Google Application .json Credentials in Environment Variables | paulie.dev](https://www.paulie.dev/posts/2024/06/how-to-use-google-application-json-credentials-in-environment-variables/)

### Local Development

With environment variables in place, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
